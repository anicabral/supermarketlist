A simple and minimalistic Supermarket List application using vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

## Usage

1. Browse through categories and find the items you need.
2. Adjust quantities as needed.
3. Mark items as purchased by clicking on them.

## Future Improvement

I am actively working on enhancing Supermarket List with the following features:

- **LocalStorage Integration:** Save your shopping list locally, so it persists even if you close the browser.
- **New Category:** Introduce the ability to create a custom category for a more personalized shopping experience.
